    "## Your Objective\n",
    "I this task you will explore the data sphere of air quality data using the OpenAQ API. \n",
    "OpenAQ provides access to a global database of air quality measurements, allowing us to analyze and compare pollution levels across different cities and regions. \n",
    "Understanding air quality is crucial for environmental research, public health, and policy-making (for more info, see this [link](https://openaq.org/why-air-quality/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your overall objective is to produce a well documented Jupyter notebook that states and answers a research question about that data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, to complete this task you need to:\n",
    "- Formulate a research question comparing air quality across selected cities or regions.\n",
    "- Retrieve relevant air quality data using the OpenAQ API.\n",
    "- Analyze, process, and visualize this data.\n",
    "- Document your findings and insights in a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the instructions in this notebook, fill the blanks and add new cells where necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "To hand in your response, upload the final notebook file in a state where it is readable like a short report. This means:\n",
    "- Restart kernel, clear all outputs\n",
    "- Rerun and test your code, make sure no error messages appear\n",
    "- Make sure your code contains enough comments to be well understandable and readable\n",
    "- Include enough markdown cells with documenting text so your analysis can be easily followed\n",
    "- Collapse all code cells, so the notebook reads like a report\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the data set and air quality measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenAQ API provides access to a wide range of air quality metrics that are crucial for assessing environmental and public health.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10)**\n",
    "  - PM2.5 and PM10 are tiny particles in the air.\n",
    "  - They can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream.\n",
    "  - Pose significant health risks, including respiratory and cardiovascular issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)**\n",
    "  - Primarily produced from fossil fuel combustion.\n",
    "  - Can aggravate respiratory diseases like asthma.\n",
    "  - High levels are often found in urban and industrial areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)**\n",
    "  - Generated from burning fossil fuels containing sulfur.\n",
    "  - Can cause acid rain and respiratory problems.\n",
    "  - Affects the environment by harming plants and aquatic life.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Carbon Monoxide (CO)**\n",
    "  - Produced by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels.\n",
    "  - A colorless, odorless, and poisonous gas.\n",
    "  - High concentrations can be lethal, and lower concentrations can cause health issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ozone (O3)**\n",
    "  - Ground-level ozone is a component of smog.\n",
    "  - Beneficial in the upper atmosphere but harmful at ground level.\n",
    "  - Can cause breathing problems, trigger asthma, and reduce lung function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparation of your work\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the task, familiarize yourself with the OpenAQ API. Here are some key points:\n",
    "- API Documentation: Review the OpenAQ [API documentation](https://docs.openaq.org/docs/introduction) to understand the available endpoints, parameters, and response formats.\n",
    "- API Requests: You will use Python’s requests library to interact with the API.\n",
    "- Data Considerations: Pay attention to data formats, available parameters (like PM2.5, NO2), and how to filter data by date, location, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is advisable to install Python, Jupyter Lab locally on your computer, so you can save your work. As fallback you can use one of the many cloud platforms to do your work online. See the seperate notebook with instructions on that for further information and instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation and grading of this task\n",
    "\n",
    "- The task is considered as completed if your code produces a table of correct data.\n",
    "- The task is done well if your code generates a single table with all scores, can display the demanded bar chart and compute the means successfully.\n",
    "- The task is done perfect if you round all values, append the mean values to the table and this way include the mean scores in your bar chart."

    "- For the final solution you will need a loop to fetch data for all the cities, but don't start this way. First get the task working for a single city, then carefully introduce more complexity to your code.\n",

    "- If you left the notebook sitting for some time, it might be inactive - the python kernel terminated. The bottom bar then does not indicate an idle kernel anymore. In that case select `Kernel -> Restart kernel` from the top menubar.\n",
    "- You have seen all required operations in the notebooks you worked through for this task; feel free to use this as copy/paste reference. Where unsure use google to find more examples of a certain operation.\n",
    "- Getting the quality scores from teleport API requires going through these steps: \n",
    "  * look up the city, get the link to the city data\n",
    "  * use the city data link to get the link to the urban area of the city\n",
    "  * use the urban area data link to get the link to the scores\n",
    "  * retrieve the scores\n",
